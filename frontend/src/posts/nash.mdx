# Nash Equilibrium & the Minds of Others

From *Algorithms to Live By*’s Game Theory chapter, an idea stuck with me: **even when everyone acts rationally, the outcome isn’t always good** — and often you need to change the rules, not the players.

## 🤔 Nash Equilibrium: Stability Over Perfection

A **Nash Equilibrium** is a strategy where no one can do better by switching unilaterally. But Christian and Griffiths point out that the equilibrium can be inefficient — a concept called the **price of anarchy**:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

### Example: Two Shopkeepers

Imagine two local shops choosing whether to open 7 days or take Sunday off. If one stays closed, customers flock to the other → so both stay open 7 days to stay competitive. That’s the equilibrium — where everyone works without rest:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

## 🪙 Rock–Paper–Scissors & Matching Pennies

I simulated games to see equilibrium in action:

### rock-paper-scissors

```python
import random

moves = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
payoffs = {("rock", "rock"): (0, 0), ("rock", "scissors"): (1, -1), ... }

def simulate(n=10000):
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        m1, m2 = random.choice(moves), random.choice(moves)
        s1, s2 = payoffs[(m1, m2)]
        p1 += s1; p2 += s2
    return p1, p2

simulate()

```
