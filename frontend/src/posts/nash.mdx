# Understanding Nash Equilibrium through Game Theory & Algorithms

Nash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory describing a **stable state** where no player benefits by changing their strategy unilaterally. In real life and strategic games, understanding Nash equilibria helps predict outcomes when multiple decision-makers interact.

This post brings together a detailed explanation of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, examples like Prisoner's Dilemma, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and insights from *Algorithms to Live By* by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths.

## Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium: When Randomizing is Optimal

In some games, pure strategies (always choosing the same option) don’t produce a stable outcome. Instead, players **randomize** their choices to avoid being exploited. This is called a **mixed strategy**.

### Example Setup: Two Strategies (A and B)

Imagine two players each choosing between:

- **Strategy A:** Help someone  
- **Strategy B:** Refuse to help

The payoffs (money earned) are shown in this matrix — the first number is Player 1’s payoff, the second is Player 2’s.

|           | Player 1: A  | Player 1: B  | 
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A** | (3, 1)      | (-2, 4)     |
| **Player 2: B** | (0, 1)      | (2, 1)      |

---

### Step 1: Define Player 1’s Payoffs Depending on Player 2’s Strategy

Let `x = P(Player 2 chooses A)`, so `1 - x = P(Player 2 chooses B)`.

- If Player 1 chooses **A**, expected payoff:

3x + (-2)(1-x) = 5x - 2

- If Player 1 chooses **B**, expected payoff:

0 * x + 2 * (1-x) = 2 - 2x

Player 2 wants to pick \( x \) to minimize Player 1’s payoff.

---

### Step 2: Find Equilibrium Probability \( x \)

Set payoffs equal to find the crossover point:

5x - 2 = 2 - 2x
7x = 4
x = 4 / 7

Player 2 should choose **A** with probability \( \frac{4}{7} \) and **B** with probability \( \frac{3}{7} \).

---

### Step 3: Define Player 2’s Payoffs Depending on Player 1’s Strategy

Let `y = P(Player 1 chooses A)`, `1 - y = P(Player 1 chooses B)`.

- If Player 2 chooses **A**, payoff:

1 * y + 4 * (1-y) = 4 - 3y

- If Player 2 chooses **B**, payoff:

1 * y + 1 * (1-y) = 1

---

### Step 4: Find Equilibrium Probability \( y \)

Set payoffs equal:

4 - 3y = 1
3y = 3
y = 1

Player 1 should always choose **A**.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma: Cooperation vs Defection

The classic Prisoner’s Dilemma highlights how rational players end up in worse outcomes:

|           | Silent (C)   | Betray (D)   |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Silent (C)** | (-1, -1)    | (-3, 0)     |
| **Betray (D)** | (0, -3)     | (-2, -2)    |

- If both stay silent, both serve 1 year.
- If one betrays and the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free, the other serves 3 years.
- If both betray, both serve 2 years.

Players want to minimize their own prison time.

---

### Player A’s Expected Payoffs

Let `x = P(Player B stays silent)`:

- If A stays silent:

(-1) * x + (-3) * (1-x) = 2x - 3

- If A betrays:

0 * x + (-2) * (1-x) = 2x - 2



Since `2x - 2 > 2x - 3`, betraying is always better. Both end up betraying, serving 2 years each — worse than mutual silence.

## From *Algorithms to Live By*: Price of Anarchy and Beyond

Christian and Griffiths show that Nash equilibria aren’t always efficient. The **price of anarchy** measures how selfish decisions hurt the group.

### Two Shopkeepers Example

Two stores deciding whether to open 7 days or close on Sunday: each fears losing customers if closed, so both stay open — no one rests. That’s a Nash equilibrium but suboptimal for well-being.

Changing rules — say, mandating Sunday off or cooperative scheduling — improves outcomes beyond Nash equilibrium.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors: Simulating Mixed Strategies in Python

In games like Rock-Paper-Scissors, players randomize to avoid predictability.

```python
import random

moves = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

# Payoff matrix: (player1_score, player2_score)
payoffs = {
    ("rock", "rock"): (0, 0),
    ("rock", "paper"): (-1, 1),
    ("rock", "scissors"): (1, -1),
    ("paper", "rock"): (1, -1),
    ("paper", "paper"): (0, 0),
    ("paper", "scissors"): (-1, 1),
    ("scissors", "rock"): (-1, 1),
    ("scissors", "paper"): (1, -1),
    ("scissors", "scissors"): (0, 0),
}

def simulate(n=10000):
    p1_score = 0
    p2_score = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        m1 = random.choice(moves)
        m2 = random.choice(moves)
        s1, s2 = payoffs[(m1, m2)]
        p1_score += s1
        p2_score += s2
    return p1_score, p2_score

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1, p2 = simulate()
    print(f"Player 1 total score: {p1}")
    print(f"Player 2 total score: {p2}")

```
